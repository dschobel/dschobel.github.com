*    Daniel is a coder living in NYC and a member of *batch\[5\]* of [Hacker School](http://www.hackerschool.com).
*    He has been writing code professionally for almost a decade and as a hobby for much longer than that.
*    Most of the professional code was in the finance industry but he eventually came to his senses and left that world behind.
*    He is willing to try anything once, even something as ridiculous as referring to himself in the third person.
*    You can reach him [via email](mailto:dschobel@gmail.com) or on [twitter](http://twitter.com/dschobel).
