###The first day of Hacker School
<pre>

####A grant experiment
When I walk into [Hacker School](http://www.hackerschool.com) on the first day
the room is already buzzing with excitement. Nobody seems to have any idea what
the next three months are going to bring but they're already comparing notes on
potential projects, definitely a good sign.

We meet the founders and they explain the theory behind the school. It is that
people learn best when they are free to pursue their interests with minimal
structure and with no fear of failure (<small>reminiscent of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling">unschooling</a></small>).The
Hacker School team places a lot of emphasis on cultivating such an environment,
consequently there are explicit rules against the sort of nit-picking comments
for which alpha-nerds are famous. 

We learn what the team's expectations are and what they tried to select for
during the interviews; namely an aspiration to become a great programmer. The
entire purpose of Hacker School is to get everyone as far along that path as
possible in our limited time. They emphasize this in opposition to spending our
time building tech demos in hopes of impressing specific potential employers.
In fact, we're told the longer we hold off thinking about jobs at all the more
we'll get out of our time here.  The message is simple: work on whatever excites
you. If you want to spend your days hacking with
[Agda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_(programming_language), go for it.

This is a remarkable piece of advice coming from a company (remember, Hacker
School is itself a startup)  which makes money by placing students at companies.
If fact, the advice actually runs in direct opposition to what would maximize
their revenue.

It was at this point that I really believed them when they say that they don't
run Hacker School to recruit but rather they recruit to be able to run Hacker
School. 

####What scares you as an engineer?
Another piece of advice given to us is to to work on things which push us far beyond
our comfort zones. Don't just work on things which are a little hard for you,
work on things which put you way out of your depth.

This is a deeply cool thing and is worth reiterating. 

Hacker School offers you space, focussed time and issues you a specific
challenge: go build that crazy project you've had in the back of your mind, your
"desert island project". You how every hacker at some point says "some day I'm
going to take my laptop and disconnect from the rest of the world and just build
my own $x". This is that time. Welcome to Hacker School.


The room is electric by the end of the talks, we quickly head to our machines
and we're off.
