### In the beginning...
I readily admit I was dubious about Hacker School for a long time. I loved the
idea of it immediately but wasn't sure if the program would be as useful for
people like me who had been working as devs for a long time (and I had almost eight
years of experience). Could I really justify flying half-way around the 
world ONE for an experimental three month program? Given some free time,
couldn't I just hack on my own projects from the comforts of home and get
most of the same benefits? 

I decided to defer answering these questions and just apply.

Two interviews later I was cautiously optimistic but still not totally sold.
What finally pushed me over the edge was, in hindsight a little silly, but in
truth it was the overwhelmingly positive comments in the HN storied about 
Hacker School. HN has a large cynical contingency these days and still I 
don't think I found anything but effusive praise in any of the Hacker 
School related threads. It was remarkable, I was finally convinced, and
two and a half weeks later I was off to NYC.



### An experiment emerges
It may be obvious that Hacker School is an experiment, but when you
walk into a room full of people you've never met before is when the idea becomes
real. Everyone is buzzing with excitement but nobody seems to have any idea 
what the next three months are going to bring. We're pretty sure it will 
involve programming, but beyond that... nothing.

The founders, Nick and Dave, open that first day with a talk and they freely
admit to the experimental nature of what they're trying to do here.

The theory behind the school, we're told, is that people learn best when they 
are free to pursue their interests, with minimal structure and with no fear of 
failure. They place a lot of emphasis on cultivating an environment which 
maximizes experimentation and minimizes fear, whether it's the fear of looking
stupid in front of your peers or fear of tackling an unfamiliar domain of 
computer science or technology.

The ultimate goal, however, is quite explicitly greatness. Obviously not
something that's achievable in our limited time but really, they want to hammer
home the point that you should strive to be great, don't just try to build
something fantastic so that you can impress potential employers. The great job
and great career should just be a nice perk of your mission for greatness. 
In fact, we're told the longer we hold off thinking about jobs the more
we'll get out of our time here. The message is simple: work on whatever excites
you.

What I found remarkable about this advice is that it is clearly in conflict with 
how Hacker School gets paid (by placing students at companies). 

It was at this point that I really believed them when they say that they don't 
run Hacker School to recruit but rather they recruit to be able to run 
Hacker School. 

###Beyond great
Beyond a general long-term goal to be great, we are told that the more 
immediate goal for the next twelve weeks is to work on things which push us 
as far beyond our comfort zones as we dare go.

This is a deeply cool thing and is worth reiterating. 

Hacker School offers you space, focussed time and issues you a specific
challenge: to build that crazy project you've had in the back of your mind, 
your "desert island project". You how every hacker at some point says 
"some day I'm going to take my laptop and disconnect from the rest of the
world and just build my own $x". Well this is that time. But they've made
the desert island better. Because now you're surrounded by smart people
wanting to build ambitious things and odds are good that someone in the
room has thought about the problem you're trying to tackle. And if they're not
in the room, someone within the alumni network.

The room is electric by the end of the talks.

Welcome to Hacker School.
