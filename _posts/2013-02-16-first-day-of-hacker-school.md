###The first day of [Hacker School]("http://www.hackerschool.com")

####An experiment emerges
When I walk into Hacker School on the first day the room is already buzzing with
excitement. Nobody seems to have any idea what the next three months are going
to bring but they're already comparing notes on potential projects, definitely a
good sign.

In short order we meet the founders and they introduce the theory behind Hacker School,
which is very similar to that of the
[unschooling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling) movement.

The theory, in a nutshell, is that people learn best when they are free to
pursue their interests with minimal structure and with no fear of failure.  The
Hacker School team places a lot of emphasis on cultivating such an environment,
so there are explicit rules against the sort of nit-picking ("well actually...")
comments for which alpha-nerds are famous.

We learn what their expectations are and what they tried to select for during
the interviews; namely an aspiration to become a great programmer. In fact, the
entire purpose of Hacker School is to get everyone as far along that path as
possible in our limited time. They emphasize this in opposition to just trying
to build tech demos to impress startups. The job and great career should just be
a side-effect of your mission for programming wizardry.  In fact, we're told the
longer we hold off thinking about jobs the more we'll get out of our time here.
The message is simple: work on whatever excites you.

This is a remarkable piece of advice coming from a company (Hacker School is
itself a startup)  which makes money by placing students at companies.

It was at this point that I really believed them when they say that they don't
run Hacker School to recruit but rather they recruit to be able to run Hacker
School. 

####What scares you as an engineer?
Beyond a general long-term goal to be great, we are told that the more immediate
goal for the next twelve weeks is to work on things which push us as far beyond
our comfort zones as we dare go.

This is a deeply cool thing and is worth reiterating. 

Hacker School offers you space, focussed time and issues you a specific
challenge: to build that crazy project you've had in the back of your mind, your
"desert island project". You how every hacker at some point says "some day I'm
going to take my laptop and disconnect from the rest of the world and just build
my own $x". Well this is that time. 

But they've made the desert island better.  Because now you're surrounded by
smart people wanting to build ambitious things and odds are good that someone in
the room has thought about the problem you're trying to tackle. In a lot of ways
it reminds me of my days as a CS grad student.

The room is electric by the end of the talks. It's clear that the time to build
is now.
